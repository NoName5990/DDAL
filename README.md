### Highlight
- üåà we present a voxel-centric online active learning baseline that efficiently reduces the labeling cost of enormous point clouds and effectively facilitates learning with a limited budget.
- ‚öñÔ∏è we introduce a novel label acquisition strategy, voxel confusion degree (VCD), that requires 1000√ó fewer annotations while reaching a close segmentation performance to that of the fully supervised counterpart. 
- üöÄ `Annotator` is generally applicable and works for different network architectures (e.g., MinkNet, SPVCNN, etc.), in distribution or out of distribution setting (i.e., AL, ASFDA, and ADA), and simulation-to-real
(SynLiDAR‚ÜíSemanticKITTI/SemanticPOSS) and real-to-real (SemanticKITTI‚ÜínuScenes and nuScenes‚ÜíSemanticKITTI) scenarios with consistent performance gains
